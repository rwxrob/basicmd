# This is a first level heading

This is the first paragraph block of the
document and line returns
do not
matter.

This paragraph has a of formatting including *emphasis*, **strong**, and
***strong-emphasis*** but not other combinations that mix them together.
Oh yea, there is `monospaced` as well but anything with _underscore_ is
ignored.

## All about lists

This section is all about lists.

* bulleted item
* another bulleted item
* third bulleted item

But what about numbered:

1. one
1. two
1. three

Or if you want:

1. one
2. two
3. three

Other types of lists, including "long" lists are not supported.

## Let's do some links

Here is an [inline link](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob) that should work but
sometimes you want to explicitly write a link to something like
<https://twitch.tv/rwxrob> or <mailto:rob@rwx.gg>.

## What about images?

So here is an image, but images must always be in their own blocks:

![image of rwxrob as gnome](https://rwx.gg/assets/img/mr-rob-gnome.jpg)

Images can also be links:

[![image of rwxrob as gnome](https://rwx.gg/assets/img/mr-rob-gnome.jpg)](https://rwxrob.tv)

## There is only one variation of separator

Separators *must* only be four dashes:

----
